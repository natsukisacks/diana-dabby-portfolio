    <h1>BUILDING A MUSIC PROGRAM AT OLIN FROM SCRATCH—AND SUSTAINING IT:  272 CONCERTS FROM FALL 2002 - SPRING 2019 (MUSIC AND ENGINEERING IV PORTFOLIO)</h1>

    <div>
        <p>With help from many inside and outside Olin, I built the Music Program at Olin from scratch.  It includes an engineers’ conductorless orchestra, a new concert series (the Ann Schaffner Concert Series, now five years old), new instruments (since 2013, a Steinway B concert piano, Yamaha B3 48” upright, bass flute, alto flute, 29” and 26” timpani), myriad student performances (272 from the Wired Ensemble, the Olin Conductorless Orchestra, and other performances I rehearsed and produced), plus a Babson-Olin-Wellesley (BOW) Presidential Innovation Grant that supported two “Mix and Stir” concerts at Olin.  The first featured two world premières by BOW faculty and the second focused on student compositions.</p>

        <p><b>INCLUDE LINKS FOR THIS </b>A colorful history of the program from 2001 – 2019 can be found in the Supplementary Materials.  We start with Years 1-9, entitled “A Recipe for Making Music (or how to bake a music program from scratch)”, found in Supplementary Materials IV-L-1.  Years 10-19 are captured in a more narrative style:  “What happened next:  stories from ‘behind the scenes’ (Development of the Music Program, Fall 2009 – Spring 2019)”, depicted in Supplementary Materials IV-L-2.</p>
            
        <p>Music is a vital tradition at Olin, reminding us of the multiple intelligences our students bring to the community and beyond.  Every year, Olin student club groups such as PowerChords, Olin Jazz Orchestra, and the Olin Rock Orchestra, as well as course groups such as the Wired Ensemble, Olin Conductorless Orchestra, and students in the AHS Capstone perform myriad concerts.   A complete listing for the latter three which arose from my courses can be found in <b>MORE LINKS Appendix IV-L:  Concerts at Olin (Fall 2002 – Spring 2019).</b></p>
            
        <p>Building the Music Program at Olin from inception to the present time required all musical parts of me:  composer, arranger, concert pianist, theorist, performer, and writer.  What I didn’t know, I learned on the job or I taught myself.  It’s been an amazing journey, exciting and creative. There’s also been a lot of behind the scenes work to ensure its sustainability.  There are many, many people to thank—something I do on the last page of every program.  So here are those names from programs during 2018-19.</p>

        <p>In sum, by building the Music Program at Olin from scratch—and sustaining it—I demonstrated Leadership and Impact across Olin’s three faculty goals of Developing Students, External Impact, and Building & Sustaining the College (Map 1), as discussed above and supported by evidence from Supplementary Materials IV-L-1 and IV-L-2, as well as the initiative, commitment, and musicianship necessary to produce the 272 concerts given in Appendix IV-L.  I’m grateful for the many people who helped, without whom we wouldn’t have a Music Program!  Yet I’m also aware that the buck stops here, and somehow the show must go on.  Building and sustaining the program required a complete musician who could guide it for the benefit of the students and the Olin community.  In bringing my skills to the table, I showed leadership by stepping in as composer, pianist, theorist, collaborator, and cheerleader, as needed.  It required an openness to ideas, as well as a high comfort level with trust and distributed authority, all of which resulted in a cornucopia of groups and music-making on campus.  In short, I followed a “meaning-making” process of leadership, as described in Section II-A-1.  The impact of the program on Olin students starts as external impact, since they first hear its results as prospective students; simply stated, it attracts students to Olin, and thus impacts the long-term sustainability of the College, especially with respect to the caliber of the student body.   Olin’s engineer-musicians are consistently among its best students, reflecting the excellence of the College.</p>   

        <p>Project L occupies the music space, yet it also lies in the engineering space because it has given our engineering students opportunities and venues for making music (Map 2).   The table below captures the role played by each of my three overarching themes in building & sustaining the Music Program, thereby speaking to Map 3.</p>
