    <h1>THE FIRST YEAR:  HELPING BUILD OLIN COLLEGE AND THE STUDENT BODY (2000-2001)</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>REATING THE RENAISSANCE ENGINEER:  SCIENTIFICALLY ASTUTE, ARTISTIC, ENTREPRENEURIAL</h2>

        <div class="caption" style="margin-left: 110px; margin-right: 110px;">
            <p>“Olin’s mission does not stop after a student graduates.  Rather it is carried forward, an integral part of each graduate, into creative endeavors far and wide.  What assures the creativity?<p>

            <p>A mind able to triangulate its corners.”</p>
        </div>

        <p>This is how I began the white paper circulated around Olin in mid-late January, 2001, when Olin consisted of just 12 faculty, a leadership team, plus administrative support; students wouldn’t arrive till the following fall.  I wrote the document because Rod Crafts, then Dean of Students, and Steve Holt (then Professor of Physics) pulled me aside in early January and said, “we believe the vision you paint for the college is the strongest so far, so why don’t you write it up.”  The resulting white paper presented the following argument: </p>

        <div class="caption" style="margin-left: 110px; margin-right: 110px;">
            <p>The Renaissance, a time of fluid boundaries between science and art, produced feats of engineering design, artistic mastery, and an entrepreneurial spirit that continue to inspire and motivate humankind.  At [Olin College of Engineering], our students learn to speak the languages of engineering, science, mathematics, the arts, and business—not as separate subjects—but all together.  We emphasize this essentially trilingual approach (engineering/science/math, arts, entrepreneurship) because we believe that a mind able to reach all its corners becomes a fully functioning intelligence capable of reaping the kind of “breakthrough” thinking that moves the human condition further [stimulation/impetus and preparation/scaffolding].</p>  

            <p>Olin students create in many fields while at the College—in engineering, mathematics, science, art/music/film/video/writing/theater/performance, and business—just as they will after graduating [application].  We believe that pursuing projects and knowledge in all of these concentrations fuels an individual’s creativity, as does the ability to communicate these pursuits to a larger audience [effective communication].  It is this synergistic creativity that is ultimately Olin’s goal—to produce and enhance the resilient, resourceful, artistic, intelligent, and technically astute individual who will take these gifts and basically go out and change the world in some way.  This catalyst for change touches another of Olin’s core values:  that change be beneficial to human kind.  Philanthropy, ethics, and communication figure prominently in the [Olin] worldview.  Towards that end, our faculty includes social scientists with specialties in past and current ethical and historical issues, as well as experts in communication so that our students have the skills to reach others with their ideas.</p>
               
            <p>Given the emphasis on creating in multiple fields which, by its very nature, often necessitates “going out on a limb”, students’ participation and ever-increasing fluency in Engineering, Entrepreneurship, the Arts helps them become more confident in their abilities. Ultimately—after an undergraduate education steeped in “doing” and “thinking” both singly and collaboratively—they find themselves comfortable with risk, having spent part of their undergraduate years becoming acquainted with it [feedback and revision].  A high comfort level with risk provides a key character trait of the entrepreneur, where entrepreneur is defined broadly as an independent, active, self-sufficient individual who “can articulate a vision and bring it to fruition” [Prof. Steve Schiffman, Senior Olin Partner].  Risk-tolerance enables graduates to pursue business opportunities, inventions, innovative projects, not to mention dreams, new theories, and ideas from which others may shrink or cast as impossible [lifelong learning and intrinsic motivation]. Of course, history is awash with great ventures that were so summarily dismissed.  Olin graduates are not shrinking violets and they do not take no for an answer!  They are a little bit uppity (though respectfully so).</p>

        <p>The complete white paper can be found here: {include link to supplementary materials II-D}</p>

        <p> “Creating the Renaissance Engineer” turned out to be a prescient work.  I personally gave each member of our faculty and administration a copy and then met with each.  The paper engendered key conversations among the Olin community.  It framed useful language by giving Olin a three-cornered vision embodying Engineering, the Arts, and Entrepreneurship.  These three anchors for our new college were next captured in a visual image which became known as the “Olin Triangle”, as shown in Figure 9. </p>

        <b>Include figure 9</b>

        <p>By showing the three “major dimensions of an Olin engineering education”, the Olin Triangle inspired our early vision, a vision that has “stood the test of time” and “is still used to guide curricular discussions”, as remarked in highly visible publication by Olin’s President (Richard Miller) , Provost (David Kerns), and Vice President for Innovation & Research (Sherra Kerns), entitled “Designing from a Blank Slate:  The Development of the Initial Olin College Curriculum”, published by the National Academies Press in 2005.</p>

        <p>In sum, by writing “Creating the Renaissance Engineer” and jumpstarting conversations among Olin stakeholders in 2001, I helped lead Olin to a cogent vision, one that had lasting impact during the critical formative years prior to ABET accreditation in 2006.  Though written 18 years ago, it speaks to developing students, as well as building & sustaining the College (Map 1), before our college-to-be had students or buildings.  It reflects my three overarching themes (Map 3)—lifelong learning, intrinsic motivation, and the creative process—to present a vision for Olin College.  By encouraging the ability to triangulate Engineering, the Arts, and Entrepreneurship, while emphasizing their synergy (Map 2), the white paper’s message still resonates with students today, given their talents in engineering and the arts.  Its curricular impact endures, as evidenced by the engineering, artistic, and entrepreneurship courses offered at Olin.</p>

        <b>{Include figure 10}</b>

        <p>20170613_215939 pink plac USE THISIn sum:  Leadership and Impact.  We’ve now come to the end of Section II (Developing Students and Building & Sustaining the College (Map 1)—encompassing both Disciplinary and Interdisciplinary Subjects (Map 2)—incorporating Three Overarching Themes (Map 3)), embodying Projects A, B, C, and D.  As evidenced by Section II and its associated Supplementary Materials and Appendices II-A through II-D, these Projects A-D not only developed students, but also helped build and sustain the College, while introducing innovations singular to Olin.  My initiative, commitment, and results—twelve “firsts” at Olin (comprising 11 new courses plus the white paper “Creating the Renaissance Engineer” which articulated an educational vision for the college and its students)—have demonstrated Leadership and Impact with respect to Olin’s faculty goals of developing students and building & sustaining the College.  In addition, my curricular contributions helped establish Olin’s ECE, Engineering, and AHS Programs, while contributing core courses required for electrical and computing engineering majors, as well as for the Olin degree.</p>

        <p>In closing Section II, I wanted to include the gift that keeps on giving.  Two years ago, I walked into Studio 305 on Fall Expo Day to start a dress rehearsal for the Wired Ensemble Event performance and found this placard slipped under my door.  Turns out a group of students prepared similar placards for every Olin faculty member—a boost for all on the final project exhibition day of the semester—Fall Expo.</p>

    <b>Do we want to include the following section?</b>
    <h2> EXTERNAL IMPACT PERTAINING TO RESEARCH AND INTELLECTUAL VITALITY (MAP 1)—ENCOMPASSING BOTH DISCIPLINARY AND INTERDISCIPLINARY WORK (MAP 2)—INCORPORATING THREE OVERARCHING THEMES (MAP 3) </h2>
    <div>
        <p>Speaking, living, and breathing two languages—one technical, the other artistic—has defined my professional life since graduating MIT in 1995.  It’s been an exciting adventure, at times fast and furious.  I love creating in both.  Every day is different.  One night an email might arrive out of the blue commissioning a new piece for a concert, the next I could be working on an innovative algorithm for musical variation, after which I might find the algorithm influencing how I’m composing a new musical work (metaphorically) and vice versa.  On a daily basis, I ‘speak’ engineering and music. This is how I like it.</p>   

        <p>My professional life in music, electrical engineering, and at the interface of the two, has spanned multiple areas, including music composition, intellectual property, a longstanding musical variations project (CantoVario), the Music Program at Olin, published works on a conductorless orchestra for engineering students, and the 100+ orchestral arrangements that have enabled a small school like Olin to have an orchestra that is self-directed.</p>
            
        <p>Section III addresses those projects that demonstrate Leadership and Impact with respect to Olin’s faculty goal of External Impact, specifically Projects E (Publication in Science), F (Patents and Trademarks Arising from the CantoVario Project), and G (Musical works:  Recent Commissions and World Premières).  Projects E and F, explicitly interdisciplinary, and Project G, primarily disciplinary, all interface with three overarching themes:  lifelong learning, intrinsic motivation, and the creative process (involving stimulation/impetus, preparation/scaffolding, application, feedback, revision, and effective communication).</p>
            
        <p>(N.B.  Section IV presents Projects H-L which will demonstrate Leadership and Impact across all three Olin faculty goals:  developing students, external impact, and building & sustaining the College.) </p>
