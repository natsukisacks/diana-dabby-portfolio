        <p>Below is a list of all grants I have been awarded throughout my career. </p> 

        <p><strong>[2024] National Science Foundation (NSF) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Supplement Grant Award.</strong>Managing Division Abbreviation: TI.  “Development of a Novel Audio Technology that Applies Dynamic System Variability to Create Musical Variations for Personal and Public Applications.” Diana Dabby, PI.  Proposal No. 2430997.  Award No. (FAIN):  1941526.  Summer 2024 support for Wellesley summer research student. 8K. </p>

        <p><strong>[2023] NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Supplement Grant Award.</strong> Managing Division Abbreviation: TI.  “Development of a Novel Audio Technology that Applies Dynamic System Variability to Create Musical Variations for Personal and Public Applications.” Diana Dabby, PI.  Proposal No. 2329978.  Award No. (FAIN):  1941526.  Summer 2023 support for 2 students, one from MIT and the other from Princeton University.  16K. </p>

        <p><strong>[2021] Olin College Integrated Project Fund.</strong>  Diana Dabby and Andrew Chang ‘24.  Designed, developed, and built the Music@Olin website for prospective students, their families, as well as all Olin students, alumni, staff and faculty.  Award date:  April 2021.  4K. </p>

        <p><strong>[2020] NSF Partnerships for Innovation—Technology Translation (PFI-TT) Grant Award.  Managing Division Abbreviation: IIP.</strong> “Development of a Novel Audio Technology that Applies Dynamic System Variability to Create Musical Variations for Personal and Public Applications.” Diana Dabby, PI.  Proposal No. 1941526.  Award No. (FAIN):  1941526. Award date:  June 1, 2020. 250K.</p>

        <p>This research and development grant enables my CantoVario project (melding musical variations, chaos science, acoustics, and signal processing) to move from prototype to product.  Symbolic systems transmit information in a variety of applications, such as DNA sequences, synthetic biology, and combinatorial chemistry. They also form the backbone of music, which can be viewed as highly context-dependent sequences of symbols where each note or event foreshadows those yet to come. The awarded technology offers new ways of engaging with music, both for music streaming service listeners and musicians. (Musicians comprise 26% of the US population.)  It brings Olin College of Engineering its first PFI-TT award, offers meaningful employment opportunities for Olin students, and signifies external recognition of the CantoVario project.

        <p><strong>[2019] Olin College Integrated Project Fund.</strong>  Diana Dabby and Luis Zuniga ‘21.  The Engineers’ Conductorless Orchestra website Hub.  Though he had never created a website, Luis taught himself the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages.  The website was a complex undertaking due to the large amount of content—as well as the variety of that content (videos, scores of orchestral arrangements, programs, etc.)—that can help engineering schools create their own conductorless orchestras.  Such orchestras build leadership, teamwork, and communication skills in engineering students.  Award date:  March 2019.  4K.  <a href="./engineers-orch.html">The Engineers' Conductorless Orchestra.</a></p>

        <p><strong>[2019] NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) National Teams Grant Award.</strong>  Managing Division Abbreviation: IIP.  “I-Corps: Harnessing Chaotic System Variability.”  Diana Dabby, PI.  Proposal no. 1924305.  Award No. (FAIN):  1924305.  Award date: April 4, 2019.  50K.  NSF site for award+abstract:  https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1924305&HistoricalAwards=false </p>

        <p><strong>[2018] NSF Travel Grant</strong> for further Customer Discovery by CantoVario, administered by MIT I-Corps and funded by NSF.  Award date:  November 2018.  1.5K. </p>

        <p><strong>[2014-17 and 2005-09] Olin Summer Innovation and Research Grants</strong>, Summers 2014-17 and 2005-09.  4K/summer for a student programmer to code algorithms I devised to produce musical variations of MIDI and Audio songs. </p>

        <p>[2015] “Mix and Stir:  musicians, composers, poets in concert.” <strong>Babson, Olin, Wellesley (BOW) Presidential Innovation Grant.</strong> Mix and Stir featured BOW student and faculty musicians, composers, and poets in two cross-disciplinary musical/literary events, enabling them to collaborate in a new venue, as part of a new Olin concert series.  Awarded 2015.  6K.  </p>
