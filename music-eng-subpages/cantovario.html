    <h1>CANTOVARIO—HARNESSING CHAOTIC SYSTEM VARIABLITY FOR MUSICAL VARIATION (ECE AND MUSIC IV PORTFOLIO)</h1>

    <div>
        <p>Though my musical variation projects encompassed by “CantoVario” now span music, electrical engineering, and entrepreneurial thinking, they began by linking only two—music and engineering—by providing a means by which music combined with chaos theory produced musical variations.  Specifically, I found a way to temper and tame a natural mechanism for variability in chaotic systems by devising a chaotic mapping, resulting in musical variation.  This technique became the cornerstone of my doctoral thesis, Musical Variations from a Chaotic Mapping.  After earning my doctorate, I expanded my ideas further, figuring out how to generate variations of audio songs, which in turn led to algorithms for making more sophisticated pitch and rhythmic variations of MIDI songs.  Because I was now working on a number of musical variation projects, I started referring to them by the umbrella term “CantoVario.”  Up to this point, CantoVario existed at the intersection of music and engineering.  But funding remained a constant issue.  My work didn’t neatly fit grant opportunities which tended to be discipline-specific.  In short, I didn’t know where to turn or what to do with CantoVario.  A colleague suggested the MIT Venture Mentoring Service (MIT VMS).  I applied in Fall 2013 and with that step, I gradually put on the entrepreneurial hat.  So my musical variation project (CantoVario) now combines music, engineering, and entrepreneurial thinking.</p>

        <p>My musical variation research (CantoVario) is significant because it allows musicians and non-musicians alike to create variations of their songs, whether in MIDI (musical instrument digital interface) format or in audio formats such as mp3 and wav.  The CantoVario project—underpinned by a number of algorithms based on my patents (granted and pending)—has been recognized by experts at the National Science Foundation (NSF) and MIT, thus demonstrating external impact.  CantoVario has also been recognized in the <a href="/website-documents/supplementary-materials/music-eng-supplementary/cantovario/A-IV-H-1-boston-sunday-globe.pdf" target="_blank">“Ideas” section of the Boston Sunday Globe</a> and in a <a href="/website-documents/supplementary-materials/music-eng-supplementary/cantovario/A-IV-H-2-artscience-article.pdf" target="_blank">chapter of a Harvard University Press book</a>.</p>

        <p>The MIT Venture Mentoring Service (VMS) selected CantoVario as one of the presenters for its 2014 Demo Day. Seventy startups applied and 20 were selected, including CantoVario. A video of CantoVario’s Demo Day five-minute presentation, given April 30, 2014, can be found below.</p>

        <p>The MIT VMS subsequently invited CantoVario to participate in its Snapshot Pitches 2016, Entrepreneurial Edge Showcase 2017, and the MIT Innovation Corps (2018), a program sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF).  In March 2019, CantoVario was selected for the National Innovation Corps (I-Corps) sponsored by NSF and awarded a 50K grant for customer discovery.</p>

        <p>As part of the NSF National Innovation Corps, the CantoVario team participated with 20 other nationally-selected teams in an intensive 7-week program.  The I-Corps program embraces the Steve Blank approach to entrepreneurship:  “getting out of the building” to interview potential users about their “jobs to be done”, e.g., what goes well in these “jobs to be done” and what doesn’t go so well.  Our team included an Olin alum as software developer (Jacob Kingery ’16) and an industry mentor (Howard Lieberman, formerly with Bose Corporation and Apple Computer).</p>
           
        <p>As the entrepreneurial lead for the CantoVario team, I completed 170 face-to-face interviews in 6½ weeks, May 6 – June 13, 2019.  These interviews yielded context as well as gain/pain points, focusing mainly on musician-producers:  amateur, student, and professional.  Here, the term musician-producer is defined as a musician who creates music as her/his/their ‘job to be done’, e.g., a singer-songwriter.  Yet many of those interviewed wear myriad musical hats:  instrumentalist, singer, songwriter, recording engineer, mixer, etc., as discovered through interviews in Nashville, Miami, and the greater Boston area.</p>  
           
        <p>In awarding the grant to the PI (Diana Dabby) and her institution (Olin College of Engineering), NSF gave Olin College its first I-Corps National Team Award, thus helping build & sustain the College.</p>

        <p>The CantoVario project has developed students’ programming and presentation skills:  Students (and alumni) assisted me in preparing and demonstrating CantoVario at the 2014 MIT Venture Mentoring Service (VMS) Demo Day, the 2016 MIT VMS Snapshot Pitches, the 2017 Entrepreneurial Edge Showcase, the 2018 keynote address for the Academy of Applied Science Young Inventors Program, and the 2019 NSF National I-Corps Teams presentations.  For the latter, each team had to prepare weekly webinar presentations on what was learned.  For our final deliverables, I-Corps required a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O4EcHjHHpA_kC4Kch0OLn1VbLrbY9ymL/view" target="_blank">2-minute video summarizing our “Lessons Learned”</a>, i.e., what our interviewees taught us, as well as a ten-minute presentation in Nashville.</p>

        <p>The <a href="www.cantovario.com">CantoVario web app </a> contains 160 mashups generated by my latest algorithms, as disclosed in “Method and Apparatus for Computer-Aided Mash-up Variations of Music and other Sequences, Including Mash-up Variation by Chaotic Mapping”, (Utility patent application 16/144521, filed USPTO Sept. 2018.)  A video on the web app landing page gives an overview of the project which encompasses both MIDI and audio applications.</p>

        <p>As a potentially disruptive audio and MIDI technology, CantoVario can alter how people interact with music on and offline.  It takes “personalized music” beyond playlists and song recommendations, allowing music lovers to directly participate in the creative process.  For musicians, it enables new avenues for developing and presenting original music to listeners for a more interactive user experience.  Finally, no differentiator yet exists that distinguishes one digital music service from another; they all advertise the same basic products—recommendations and playlists.  By offering direct interaction with songs and playlists to create new songs that can be shared with others, CantoVario offers a unique experience for music streaming service customers.</p>
            
        <p>Currently, CantoVario encompasses three related projects, as described in <a href="/website-documents/supplementary-materials/music-eng-supplementary/cantovario/IV-H-4-current-projects.pdf">this document</a>, that unite chaos science with musical variation.  The first addresses a music maker’s worst pain point, while projects 2 and 3 expand the technology to wider audiences through a novel music/STEM exhibit prototype for a science museum and a new listening experience for concert-goers (the “variation concert”).</p>
            
        <p>All three projects rely on CantoVario’s core technology that employs a dissipative chaotic system, e.g., the Lorenz equations, to generate musical variations.  Most engineers seek ways to eliminate chaos, but I thought it could be used.  In its ‘chaotic regime’, the Lorenz system possesses a natural mechanism for variability due to the sensitivity of its solutions to initial conditions.  I found a way to exploit that built-in variability to produce variations of a context-dependent sequence of symbols, where the variant output can be close to the original work, mutate beyond recognition, or achieve degrees of variability in between.</p>
            
        <p>In sum, through the CantoVario project, I have demonstrated Leadership and Impact across Olin’s three faculty goals.  With respect to developing students, I displayed initiative, leadership,  and impact in writing proposals that received funding from various Olin summer research programs, enabling students to work on CantoVario—a project they loved—while further developing their programming and presentation skills.  As the PI for CantoVario’s I-Corps grant, I brought Olin College of Engineering its first I-Corps National Team Award due to a successful NSF grant that I wrote, again showing initiative, leadership, and impact for building and sustaining the College.   With respect to external impact, I have demonstrated leadership by articulating an idea and bringing it to fruition.  In doing so, I did not apply science to art, nor art to science.  Rather, I took a fundamental concept in chaos science (sensitive dependence on initial conditions) and a fundamental concept in music (variation), then created something completely original and nonrepresentational, as evidenced by my MIT doctoral thesis and issued patents.  This process was remarked upon in an article written by Science Reporter Carolyn Y. Johnson for the Ideas Section of the Boston Sunday Globe in 2013:</p>
