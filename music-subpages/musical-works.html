<h1>MUSICAL WORKS: COMMISSIONS AND WORLD PREMIÈRES (MUSIC IV PORTFOLIO)</h1>

<div>
    <p>>Musical variation has infused my creative process ever since I devised the original chaotic mapping technique for making musical variations of original works.</p> 

    <p>Now after years of working with CantoVario, I find my compositional style has become infused with thousands of variations.  They have permeated my musical being, especially those works composed since 2011:  <em>September Quartet</em>, a large scale work that received its world première on the tenth anniversary of 9/11; the piano compositions <em>Tre Studi di Colore</em> (2012) and <em>Fuente y Variación</em> (2013); the 2017 trio (violin, cello, piano) <em>Who was Wissam Eid?</em>, and the five-movement work <em>Parallel Lives—Distant Mirrors</em> (2018) where the variation path heard by listeners during the fifth movement depends on seat location.</p>

    <p><b>September Quartet</b> (2011)</p>

    <p>Composed for chorus, winds, brass, percussion, violin and piano, September Quartet was commissioned by Tufts University for the New Music Ensemble, John McDonald, Director, in commemoration of the Tufts Sesquicentennial.  An integral part of the piece involves the gradual illumination of the names representing the 246 non-hijacker passengers and crew members of the four planes obliterated on September 11, 2001, hence the name September Quartet.  Lasting approximately 30 minutes, the five movements are titled:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Beginning</li> 
        <li>77—175</li>
        <li>93</li> 
        <li>11</li> 
        <li>End</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Tre Studi di Colore </b> (2012)</p>

    <p>These three études for solo piano – Azzurro (for right hand alone), Rosso (for left hand alone), and Violetto (for two hands) – offer a dramatic and athletic tour de force for the pianist.  Their interpretation relies on certain interpretive slants, e.g., hearing the piano embrace different instruments of the orchestra (and at times, a military band).  Commissioned by the Three-College Collaboration (Babson, Olin, Wellesley) for the Jubilee Trio’s Houghton Chapel concert, Wellesley College, Nov. 2012, these études were later performed abroad (May 30, 2013) by pianist Jongsun Lee who won an emerging artists’ competition awarding her a debut recital at Youngsan Art Hall in Seoul, Korea.</p>

    <p><b>Fuente y Variación </b> (2013)</p>

    <p><em>Fuente y Variación</em> (source and variation) was commissioned by pianist Jongsun Lee for her invited artist concert sponsored by Youngsan Art Hall, Seoul, Korea, May 2013.  The piece presents another perspective on classical variation form:  first the audience hears an original piece (기원) and then a variation (변화) of it.  The variation diverges in substantive ways from the original, yet the two pieces stay connected through motivic and thematic reinterpretation.  In a broad sense, the music has become dynamic – it changes with time as a river might change from day to day, season to season, yet is still recognized in its essence.</p>

    <p><b>Who was Wissam Eid? </b> (2017)</p>

    <p>Commissioned by the Babson, Olin, Wellesley Collaboration and scored for violin, cello, and piano, <em>Who was Wissam Eid?</em> grew out of a New York Times article “The Hezbollah Connection” by Ronen Bergman.  Bergman investigated the 2005 assassination of Rafik Hariri, the former prime minister of Lebanon who sought to unyoke Lebanon from Assad’s Syria.  Wissam Eid, a young Lebanese police detective and former engineering student, unraveled the plot—initially blamed on a 22-year old religious Sunni Muslim (Ahmad Abu Adass).  Family and friends described Adass as kind and generous; sadly, the plotters took advantage of his kindness to set him up as the fall guy for the murder of Hariri.  Eid doubted the setup, instead approaching the case with a novel idea:  on his own time, he tracked records of cell phone traffic, eventually identifying five members of Hezbollah, a militant group loyal to Bashar al-Assad, as responsible for the entire plot.  In reading the story, I fell in love with Wissam Eid, hoping he would somehow escape the fate of Hariri and Adass.  His car was blown up in 2008.  He was 31.   </p>

    <p>The 10-minute work for violin, cello, and piano has three movements:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Ahmad Abu Adass</li>
        <li>Rafik Hariri</li>
        <li>Wissam Eid</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>Parallel Lives—Distant Mirrors </b> (2018)</p>

    <p><em>Parallel Lives—Distant Mirrors</em> for piano, flute, voice, and soundscape, received its world première on the Wellesley College Concert Series, November 10, 2018.  The work explores parallel universes in Iraq and the United States.  It offers the audience <b>a concert of “Variations and Shadows” where seat location determines what variation path through a piece is heard by the audience.</b>  I’ve talked about such a “variation concert” in formal concert/lectures and informal talks since 1994.  The world première performance utilized sound-focusing technology developed by Kevin Brown of Brown Innovations.  To our knowledge, this is the first “variation concert” ever presented. </p>

    <p>Five movements comprise the 30-minute work:  </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Ignition (solo piano), at minute 05:25 of the YouTube precording</li>
        <li>The Last Minutes of Baghdad TV (bass and alto flutes + projection), at minute 15:28</li>
        <li>An Iraqi Mother’s Lament (voice and piano), at minute 19:13 
        <li>Quranic Verses 16:111 – 16:114 (speaker and alto flute), at minute 24:33</li>
        <li>Catharsis (piano + soundtrack), at minute 26:04</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The culminating movement includes a soundtrack composed of Associated Press recordings from the 2003 bombardment of Iraq, the last minutes of Iraqi TV, recorded American and Iraqi voices, among others.  Movements 2, 3, and 4, each focus on one of the Arabic voice recordings but in translation.  The text for the third movement for voice and piano can be found in the YouTube description.</p>

    <p><b>In sum</b>, the above five works lie in the disciplinary space of music (Map 2), yet all were influenced by my work with musical variations from a chaotic mapping.  They demonstrate Leadership and Impact with respect to Olin’s faculty goal of External Impact (Map 1) by reaching out to audiences in concert and online.  All five world premières were well-attended and four occurred as part of established concert series in excellent venues:  Distler Performance Hall, Perry and Marty Granoff Music Center, Tufts University Concert Series; Youngsan Art Hall Concert Series, Seoul, Korea; and Houghton Memorial Chapel, Wellesley College Concert Series.  <b>September Quartet</b> received a spontaneous standing ovation as can be seen on the YouTube video.  It has been viewed 702 times from two different YouTube uploads, the first of which (500 views) was removed in favor of the second (202 since April 2014).  The movements comprising the piano pieces <b>Tre Studi di Colore</b> (2012) and <b>Fuente y Variación</b> (2013) have a total of 1,706 views (since December 2013), showing some movements dominating others, e.g., Variación with 582 listens.  Together with <b>Who was Wissam Eid?</b>  (383 since May 2017) and <b>Parallel Lives—Distant Mirrors</b> (205 since December 2018), these five works, have reached an online audience of 3000 despite requiring longer attention spans.  All of the above speaks to Impact. </p>

    <p>In composing these works, I demonstrated Leadership through an innovative approach to each:  the gradual illumination of names throughout September Quartet, representing the 246 non-hijacker passengers and crew members of the four planes obliterated on September 11, 2001; structuring the movements of Tre Studi di Colore for each hand alone and then hands together; presenting another perspective on classical variation form in Fuente y Variación where the audience first hears an original piece and then a variation of that piece; writing Who was Wissam Eid? so it starts out of nowhere and out of sight, with the movements (and instrumentalists) as characters in an unfolding drama; and creating a “variation concert” for Parallel Lives—Distant Mirrors where seat location determines which variation path is heard during the final movement.</p>

    <p>The thematic table below succinctly captures the role played by each of my three overarching themes in Project G, thus speaking to Map 3.</p>

    <p><b>include overarching themes</b></p>

    <p><b>Include the following? </b></p>
    <h2>INTELLECTUAL VITALITY UNITING EXTERNAL IMPACT, DEVELOPING STUDENTS, AND BUILDING & SUSTAINING THE COLLEGE (MAP 1)—ENCOMPASSING BOTH DISCIPLINARY AND INTERDISCIPLINARY WORK (MAP 2)—EMBODYING THREE OVERARCHING THEMES (MAP 3) </h2>

    <p>Four large projects comprise this section.  Each speaks to External Impact, Developing Students, and Building & Sustaining the College:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>CantoVario (my musical variations project)</li>
        <li>The Engineers’ Conductorless Orchestra project</li>
        <li>The 100+ orchestral arrangements I’ve created for nontraditional instrumentation (as occurs in the Olin Conductorless Orchestra)</li>
        <li>Building the Music Program at Olin from scratch—and sustaining it. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The CantoVario projects integrate my Electrical Engineering and Music IV Portfolios and demonstrate External Impact (recognized by external experts), Developing Students (knowledge and skills growth), and Building & Sustaining the College (external recognition for the College), as discussed in <b>Include link</b></p>

    <p>The book chapter “The Engineers’ Orchestra:  a conductorless orchestra for our time” (elaborated below in Section IV-J) shows how a conductorless orchestra develops professional skills in engineering students, fosters external impact by enabling the conductorless orchestra model to reach a larger audience, thus helping build & sustain the college’s reputation as an incubator for innovation in engineering education.  Section IV, Project J also introduces the new Engineers’ Conductorless Orchestra Hub—a website of resources and materials exportable to other engineering schools considering a conductorless orchestra for their musician-engineers.</p>
        
    <p>Section IV, Project K gives an overview of the 100+ orchestral arrangements I have created for the Olin Conductorless Orchestra (OCO), now available to other engineering schools.  These orchestral arrangements have external impact because they remove the barrier to procuring music for orchestras with non-standard instrumentation, a likely occurrence for an engineering school wanting to start its own conductorless orchestra. Thus a conductorless orchestra for developing engineering students to lead, team, and effectively communicate becomes possible for other schools.  Such an orchestra can help them attract prospective students, in similar ways to how OCO has helped Olin attract students, thereby helping build & sustain their schools, as well as ours.  Just as my arrangements have enabled a small college like Olin to have an orchestra—despite nonstandard instrumentation across unbalanced wind, brass, and string sections, as has been noted by students, staff, faculty, parents, and a trustee—they can open the conductorless door to others.</p>
        
    <p>The Music Program at Olin (further discussed in L below)—has shown impact outside Olin by virtue of its visibility to external constituents through concerts.  It has continually developed students by offering performance opportunities inside and outside Olin. By showcasing students’ multifaceted talents, the program underscores Olin’s dedication to both technical and artistic pursuits, thus helping build & sustain the college’s reputation.  Perhaps most importantly, it has given students “balance” in their engineering studies, or as one student put it, “No music, no life.”</p>
        
    <p>The above Projects H-L are interdisciplinary in nature (uniting music and engineering) with the CantoVario project spanning engineering, music, and entrepreneurial thinking.  My three overarching themes infuse all of them. </p>
